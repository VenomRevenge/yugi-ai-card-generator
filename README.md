## Features

- **Dynamic Card Type**:  
  - Choose a card type (Trap, Monster, or Spell) based on the title you provide, and the app dynamically applies styles.

- **Attributes and Levels**:  
  - Displays the cardâ€™s level using PNG stars.  
  - Marks the card as Continuous (for Spells/Traps), Quickplay (for Spells), or Counter (for Traps).  

- **Monster Details**:  
  - Includes Monster Type (e.g., Warrior, Spellcaster, Machine).  
  - Displays ATK and DEF stats.

> **Note:**  
> The card has fixed styles so you probably shouldn't be viewing it in mobile or a small screen.
